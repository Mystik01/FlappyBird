# User Documentation

## Installation:

Flappy Bird is a web based game written in JavaScript so can be played in your browser. I have provided the local code attached in a zip file but shouldn’t need to install anything to run it. 

### Running online:

I have the game running on my GitHub live so shouldn’t require any installation. On there you can also view the code without downloading it. This will be the most up-to-date version as well.

### Running locally:

To run the game simply direct into the ~/public folder and open the index.html file.

## How to play?

The game is quite simple to play, simply hit space or click with your mouse if running on a computer to make the bird jump. The aim of the game is to get through as many gaps as possible and your live score is tracked in the top left. 

The games does also work on mobile but is not as responsive and not recommended. 

## Reporting bugs:

Bugs can be reported into my Github through this link [https://github.com/Mystik01/FlappyBird/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/Mystik01/FlappyBird/issues/new/choose)

This will allow you to either create a bug report or feedback report. Users are also welcome to collaborate and expand on the code/improve it’s performance or compatibility and can submit that in the PR section.

## Technical info:

The game tracks your highest score in your browsers cookies and is the only data which it tracks and stores. The whole game is client sided and the code is only hosted GitHub. The actual game is run on your pc so if you have an older/slower computer it may impact the performance. All computers and mobiles should be able to run this fine without any performance issues however mobile isn’t completely compatible. You do need to have a newish/updated browser to play, e.g old internet explorer would not be able to run this. This shouldn’t be an issue for majority of users.
